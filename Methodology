Performance:
1. The SFSS has a mechanic of control throughput, preventing sensors from continuously uploading data to external system.
2. Reponse time must be relatively small to assure UX.

Reliability:
1. Cow location must be 100% accurate.
2. Cow health status must be > 90% reliable.
3. The statistics must describe exactly data supplied by external systems.
4. Feeding must feed the cow evenly, assure fair between cows.
5. The stable must be cleaned outrightly.

Availability: 
1. Sensors must be available 24/24, continuously keeps track of cow status and sends data to other system.
2. Close-to-calving notifications must be pushed every 5 minutes.ke
3. In case of system down, it must ta

Usability:
The application has a strategy of instructing user the usage step by step for the first time of use.

Security: 
The SFSS require user to login by username and password to perform any actions in the system.

Recoverability: 
Data of the whole system is backed up by other Cloud Storage System. Every update on one storage system is also updated in other storage systems.
